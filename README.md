password123
Weak (common, easy to guess)
IloveIndia2025
Weak (common, but longer)
Qwerty@123
Medium (predictable, but improved)
Pa$$w0rd
Weak (pattern-based)
Mys@f3B@nk!2025
Medium (uses symbols & caps)

Step 3: Password Testing
Tested each password on Security.org and putted screenshots.
Step 4: Scores and Feedbacks
Scored time to crack and feedback put these.
password123
Scores: Time to crack - 1 month
Feedback: Too common, weak.
IloveIndia2025
Scores: Time to crack - 9 million years
Feedback: Technically strong due to length (13 characters) and mix of uppercase, lowercase, and numbers. Adding symbols and using uncommon words can improve it.
Qwerty@123
Scores: Time to crack - 5 years
Feedback: Pros: Uses uppercase and lowercase letters, includes a number and a special character (@). Cons: Based on a common pattern (Qwerty123), predictable.
Pa$$w0rd
Scores: Time to crack - 1 week
Feedback: Common word + leet + too short. Extend length. Weak due to guessable format.
Mys@f3B@nk!2025
Scores: Time to crack - 41 trillion years
Feedback: Long, random, strong use of symbols, mixed case, and digits.
!&X4g!8#Tf2ZbPq
Scores: Time to crack - 41 trillion years
Feedback: Highly secure, random, long, complex format.
Step 5: Identify Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
- Use long passwords (12+ characters).
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.
- Avoid common words and predictable patterns.
- Don't reuse passwords across sites.
Step 6: Tips Learned from the Evaluation
- Passwords using leetspeak (e.g., Pa$$w0rd) are still weak if predictable.
- Length plays a major role in cracking time.
- Random combinations with symbols are much stronger.
Step 7: Research Common Password Attacks
- Brute Force: Trying all combinations until success.
- Dictionary Attack: Using a list of common passwords.
- Phishing and keylogging are also indirect password threats.
Step 8: Summary of Password Complexity and Security
Password complexity significantly affects security. Longer passwords with mixed characters and randomness are exponentially harder to crack. Avoiding predictable patterns and using unique passwords for different accounts is essential for maintaining cybersecurity.
